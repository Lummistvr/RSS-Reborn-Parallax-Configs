Legacy parallax 2.0 configs for Ballistic Fox's RSS-Reborn.

*Notice: These configs are all adapted from Linux's stock system configs, and as such I do not own anything here*


Added ground parallax to the following celestials:
-Mercury
-Venus
-Vesta
-Callisto
-Triton
-Pluto
-Charon

Added parallax scatters to the following celestials:
-Mercury
-Venus
-Moon
-Mars
-Vesta
-Ceres
-Callisto
-Triton
-Pluto
-Charon

To do(maybe?):
-Add full support for the remaining Jovian moons
-Add full support for Titan
-Perhaps Uranus system?
