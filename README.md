Legacy parallax 2.0 configs for Ballistic Fox's RSS-Reborn.

*Notice: These configs are all adapted from Linux's stock system configs, and as such I do not own anything here*


Added ground parallax to the following celestials:
-Mercury
-Venus
-Vesta
-Callisto
-Triton
-Pluto
-Charon

Added parallax scatters to the following celestials:
-Mercury
-Venus
-Moon
-Mars
-Vesta
-Ceres
-Callisto
-Triton
-Pluto
-Charon

To do(maybe?):
-Add full support for the remaining Jovian moons
-Add full support for Titan
-Perhaps Uranus system?


To change any configs for any of the planets, the scatter configs are located in this directory: GameDate/RSS-Terrain/Scatters/Configs/xxx.cfg
For ease of use, in game press Ctrl + P to open a parallax config window for the celestial your landed on, change whatever you want and manually update the appropriate config in the folder above.
If you want to change the ground parallax: GameDate/RSS-Terrain/Terrain/Parallax.cfg

Refer to the Stock Parallax folder for any textures/scatter configs if you want to add/update stuff:3
